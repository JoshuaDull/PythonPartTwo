# Python Part Two

This repo contains workshop materials for the introductory workshop: _Python Part Two_.  Part Two will focus on working with data in python using the pandas library. 

You can find Part One of this workshop here: [Python Part One](https://joshuadull.github.io/PythonPartOne/).

For this workshop, I recommend installing Python 3 using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). The workshop was built using the Spyder IDE, but users can use any python environment they prefer.
